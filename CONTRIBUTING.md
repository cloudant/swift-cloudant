## General information

### Adding files

Production source files are stored in the `Source` tree with tests stored in the
`Tests` tree.

`Tests/SwiftCloudantTests` contains all the tests for the `SwiftCloudant` module.

## Requirements

Starting from scratch you'll need:

* Xcode
* Xcode command line tools
* [Swift 3 or 4](https://swift.org/getting-started/#installing-swift)

First, download Xcode from the app store or [ADC][adc].

When this is installed, install the command line tools. The simplest way is:

```sh
xcode-select --install
```

### Getting started with the project

The Swift Package Manager is the default build tool for SwiftCloudant. In order
to use Xcode as a development envrionment run the command:

```sh
$ swift package generate-xcodeproj
```

## Building

```sh
swift build
```

## Testing

### Test Configuration

By default, the tests will attempt to use CouchDB located at `http://localhost:5984`,
these can be configured using the Test Bundle's `TestSettings.plist` file. The properties
are as follows:

| Property Name | Purpose | Default |
|---------------|---------|---------|
| TEST_COUCH_URL | The URL to connect to | http://localhost:5984 |
| TEST_COUCH_USERNAME | The username to use when accessing the server | `nil` |
| TEST_COUCH_PASSWORD | The password to use when accessing the server | `nil`|


Note: Since the move to using the SwiftPackageManager test configuration options
currently do not work. For now tests will only connect to `http://localhost:5984`

### Running the tests

Run:
```bash
export TOOLCHAINS=swift
swift build
swift test
```

or if you have a generated xcode project you can use:
```bash
export TOOLCHAINS=swift
xcodebuild -project SwiftCloudant.xcproj -scheme SwiftCloudant test
```

Currently only OS X / macOS is supported for testing.

__NOTE__: You should also check that any changes made compile using the Swift Package Manager,
use the command `swift build` in the root of the checkout to compile using the Swift Package Manager.
